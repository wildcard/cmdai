# QA Coverage Matrix

**Last updated**: 2026-09-07

This file drives Slot C surface selection. Pick the row with the oldest 'Last tested' value (treat 'never' as oldest). Tie-break randomly.

## Smoke (Slot A) coverage

One row per pass. Update 'Last tested' column after every Slot A run.

| Date | Build | --version | --help | doctor | dry-run | Notes |
|------|-------|-----------|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| 2026-05-07 | PASS | PASS (1.3.0) | PASS | PASS | FLAKE | Model download blocked in sandbox (see flakes); first bootstrap run |
| 2026-09-07 | PASS | PASS (1.5.0) | PASS | PASS | FLAKE | FLAKE-001 2nd occurrence; telemetry prompt required TTY; proxy blocks www.caro.sh redirect |

## Feature surface table

Slot C selects from this table. Update 'Last tested', 'Result', and 'Linked issue(s)' after each Slot C exercise.

## Surfaces added by bug filings

When a filed issue reveals a new surface gap, add it here so Slot C tracks it in a future pass.

| Issue | Surface | Domain | Filed | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| [#1044](https://github.com/wildcard/caro/issues/1044) | CLAUDE.md version field alignment | docs | 2026-05-07 | closed |
| [#1442](https://github.com/wildcard/caro/issues/1442) | CLAUDE.md version drift recurrence (1.4.0 vs 1.5.0) | docs | 2026-09-07 | open |

## Notes

- Slot C tie-break: when multiple surfaces share 'never', pick lowest `#` number unless context suggests a riskier surface is more valuable to exercise.
- Website surfaces (#25, #26) can be tested with `curl` + Python parsing alone — no caro build needed.
- Surfaces requiring model download (#19, #20) should be tested from an environment with a pre-downloaded model; note in session log if sandbox blocks download.
- `caro.sh` root redirects to `www.caro.sh` (HTTP 307); sandbox proxy blocks redirect target. `/he/` and other locale paths work directly.
- `caro.sh/en/` returns 404 by design: `prefixDefaultLocale: false` in `website/astro.config.mjs` — English lives at `/`.
- P1 bug #1375: `caro ai --once` CPU backend always returns `echo 'Please clarify your request'` on Linux x86_64. Re-test surface #10 after fix.
