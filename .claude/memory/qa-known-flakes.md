# QA Known Flakes

Document flaky behaviours observed during QA runs. A flake observed 3+ times in 7 days should be reclassified as a regression and filed as a GitHub issue.

### FLAKE-001: Model download failure in remote sandbox

**First observed**: 2026-05-07  
**Symptom**: `caro -p "..." --dry-run` fails with `Backend is not available: Failed to download model after 3 attempts` after 3 retries (2s, 4s backoff). Also causes `caro ai --once` to hang until process timeout (exit 143).  
**Context**: Remote CI/QA sandbox where `https://huggingface.co/` returns HTTP 200 but binary blob downloads time out or are blocked at a lower network layer.  
**Impact**: Slot A `--dry-run` smoke check and Slot C `caro ai --once` cannot be completed in this environment. Use `caro --version`, `--help`, and `doctor` as proxy for binary health; use `cargo test --lib` for functional coverage.  
**Occurrence log**:
- 2026-05-07: observed on `caro -p 'list files' --dry-run`
- 2026-09-08: observed again on `caro ai --once 'list files'` (exit 143 after 25s timeout); also on `caro -p 'list files' --dry-run` (blocked at telemetry consent in fresh sandbox — different surface, same environment limitation)

**Promotion threshold**: File regression issue if observed 3 times in 7 days OR if it reproduces on a known-good environment with a pre-downloaded model.  
**Workaround**: Run from an environment with `~/.cache/caro/models/` pre-populated, or with Ollama installed as fallback backend.
