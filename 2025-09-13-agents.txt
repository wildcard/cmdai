  ## 🔧 Configuration

  ### Backend Configuration

  #### MLX (Default - macOS Apple Silicon)
  Optimized for Apple Silicon Macs using Metal acceleration:
  ```bash
  cmdai --backend mlx --model "mlx-community/Llama-3.2-8B-Instruct-4bit"
  ```

  #### vLLM (Remote GPU Server)
  For high-performance GPU clusters:
  ```bash
  # Start vLLM server
  vllm serve meta-llama/Llama-3.2-8B-Instruct

  # Use with cmdai
  cmdai --backend vllm --endpoint http://localhost:8000 "your prompt"
  ```

  #### Ollama (Local Multi-Platform)

  ```bash
  # Install and start Ollama
  ollama serve
  ollama pull llama3.2

  # Use with cmdai
  cmdai --backend ollama --endpoint http://localhost:11434 "your prompt"
  ```

  ### Model Management

  Models are automatically downloaded and cached using Hugging Face's hub:

  ```bash
  # Custom cache directory
  export HF_HOME=/path/to/models
  cmdai "your prompt"

  # Or specify directly
  cmdai --cache-dir /path/to/models "your prompt"
  ```

  **Supported model formats:**
  - MLX: `.safetensors` quantized models
  - vLLM: Standard Hugging Face transformers
  - Ollama: GGUF format models

  ### Environment Variables

  | Variable | Description | Default |
  |----------|-------------|---------|
  | `HF_HOME` | Hugging Face cache directory | `~/.cache/huggingface` |
  | `CMDAI_BACKEND` | Default backend | `mlx` |
  | `CMDAI_MODEL` | Default model | Auto-detected |
  | `CMDAI_ENDPOINT` | Default endpoint for remote backends | `http://localhost:8000` |
  | `RUST_LOG` | Logging level | `warn` |

  ## 🛡️ Safety Features

  cmdai prioritizes safety and will **block dangerous commands** by default:

  ### Blocked Patterns
  - System destruction: `rm -rf /`, `mkfs.*`
  - Fork bombs: `:(){ :|:& };:`
  - Device writes: `> /dev/sda`
  - Privilege escalation without explicit request

  ### Safety Override
  For advanced users who need to run potentially dangerous commands:
  ```bash
  cmdai --allow-dangerous "format USB drive /dev/disk2"
  ```

  ### Command Validation
  Before execution, cmdai:
  1. ✅ Validates command syntax
  2. ✅ Checks against dangerous patterns
  3. ✅ Shows clear preview with syntax highlighting
  4. ✅ Requires explicit confirmation (unless `--auto`)

  ## 🏗️ Development

  ### Prerequisites
  - Rust 1.70+ with Cargo
  - macOS with Apple Silicon (for MLX backend)
  - Docker (for development container)

  ### Building from Source
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/username/cmdai.git
  cd cmdai
  cargo build --release
  ```

  ### Development Container

     Key Findings:

     1. Implementation Status:
       - Basic CLI structure implemented with clap
       - Module architecture defined (backends, safety, cache, config, etc.)
       - Backend trait system designed for multiple LLM integrations
       - Safety validation framework established but not fully implemented
       - Tests are contract-based, waiting for implementation
     2. Dependencies Already Configured:
       - Core: clap, tokio, serde, reqwest
       - UI: colored, dialoguer, indicatif
       - Platform: directories, sysinfo
       - Model management: hf-hub
       - Optional MLX support via cxx feature flag
     3. Project Structure:
       - Well-organized modular architecture
       - Separate modules for backends, safety, cache, config
       - Test structure with contract-based testing approach
       - Comprehensive specification in specs/ directory

     README Structure I'll Create:

     1. Clear project description with current development status
     2. Realistic features based on what's planned/partially implemented
     3. Installation instructions appropriate for early-stage project
     4. Usage examples with clear indication of what's working vs planned
     5. Architecture overview based on actual module structure
     6. Development setup with actual commands from Makefile
     7. Contributing guidelines for early-stage contributors
     8. Correct license (AGPL-3.0, not MIT)
     9. Roadmap showing current vs planned features

     The README will be honest about the project's early development stage while showcasing its potential and well-thought-out architecture.

● Write(README.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 311 lines to README.md                                                                                                                                 
     # cmdai
     > 🚧 **Early Development Stage** - Architecture defined, core implementation in progress
     **cmdai** converts natural language descriptions into safe POSIX shell commands using local LLMs. Built with Rust for blazing-fast performance, single-binary
     distribution, and safety-first design.
     ```bash
     $ cmdai "list all PDF files in Downloads folder larger than 10MB"
     Generated command:
       find ~/Downloads -name "*.pdf" -size +10M -ls
     … +301 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Created a comprehensive README.md that accurately reflects the current state of the cmdai project. Key features:

  1. Honest Status: Clearly marked as early development with architecture defined but implementation in progress
  2. Correct License: Referenced AGPL-3.0 instead of MIT
  3. Realistic Features: Distinguished between completed, in-progress, and planned features
  4. Actual Structure: Based on the real module structure found in the codebase
  5. Development Instructions: Used actual commands from the Makefile
  6. Clear Roadmap: Phased approach showing current progress and future plans
  7. Appropriate Examples: Marked functionality as "planned" or "target" where not yet implemented

  The README provides transparency about the project's early stage while showcasing its well-designed architecture and potential.

> write a prompt for an agent that updates the readme as the project progress and manage a roadmap.md and keep a changelog.md and know how to work with github 
  releases via gh cli

● I'll create a comprehensive prompt for a documentation management agent that maintains project documentation and handles releases.

● Write(DOCUMENTATION_AGENT_PROMPT.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 200 lines to DOCUMENTATION_AGENT_PROMPT.md                                                                                                             
     # Documentation & Release Management Agent Prompt
     You are a specialized documentation and release management agent for the cmdai project. Your primary responsibilities are maintaining project documentation,
     tracking progress, and managing releases.
     ## Core Responsibilities
     ### 1. README.md Maintenance
     - **Monitor Implementation Progress**: Regularly scan the codebase to identify completed features, new modules, and functionality changes
     - **Update Status Sections**: Keep the "Project Status" section current with:
       - ✅ Completed features (moved from "In Progress" when implementation is verified)
     … +190 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Created a comprehensive documentation and release management agent prompt that includes:

  Key Features:

  1. README Maintenance - Automated tracking of feature completion, status updates, and performance metrics
  2. ROADMAP.md Management - Milestone tracking, phase documentation, priority levels, and progress indicators
  3. CHANGELOG.md - Following Keep a Changelog format with proper versioning and categories
  4. GitHub Release Automation - Complete release workflow using gh CLI:
    - Pre-release checklist
    - Tag creation and pushing
    - Release creation with notes
    - Binary uploads
    - Post-release tasks
  5. Automation Triggers - Clear guidelines on when to update docs (PR merges, weekly reviews, releases)
  6. Quality Checks - Verification steps before documentation updates
  7. Git Integration - Commit message parsing for automatic changelog updates
  8. CI/CD Suggestions - GitHub Actions integration for automated documentation workflows

  The agent will maintain accuracy by regularly scanning the codebase, tracking implementation progress, and ensuring documentation always reflects the actual
  project state rather than aspirational features.

● Claude Opus limit reached, now using Sonnet 4

● Created a comprehensive .gitignore file that covers:

  1. Rust-specific - Target directory, build artifacts, debug symbols
  2. IDE/Editor files - VS Code, IntelliJ, Vim, Sublime, etc.
  3. Environment - .env files, temporary files, OS artifacts
  4. ML/LLM specific - Model cache, .bin/.safetensors files, MLX artifacts
  5. Development - Test coverage, benchmarking, documentation builds
  6. Security - Keys, certificates, secrets directories
  7. Claude Code specific - .claude directory and conversation exports
  8. Release artifacts - Distribution files, packages
  9. Local overrides - Local configuration files

  The .gitignore is designed specifically for the cmdai project's needs while being comprehensive enough to handle future additions like model files, release
  artifacts, and development tools.
