## [Unreleased]

### Added - Feature 003: Core Infrastructure Modules

#### Cache Module (`src/cache/`)
- **CacheManager**: Model caching with Hugging Face integration
  - LRU eviction algorithm for cache size management
  - SHA256 checksum validation for model integrity
  - Offline-first operation with manifest persistence
  - XDG Base Directory compliance for cross-platform support
- **ManifestManager**: JSON-based cache metadata management
  - Automatic manifest creation and persistence
  - Cache statistics tracking (total size, model count)
  - Integrity validation and corruption detection

#### Config Module (`src/config/`)
- **ConfigManager**: TOML-based configuration management
  - Load/save user preferences with validation
  - CLI argument override support (`merge_with_cli`)
  - Environment variable override support (`merge_with_env`)
  - Schema validation with deprecated key warnings
- **ConfigSchema**: Configuration validation logic
  - Known keys/sections tracking
  - Deprecated key migration support

#### Execution Module (`src/execution/`)
- **ExecutionContext**: System context capture for LLM prompts
  - Current directory, shell type, platform detection
  - Environment variable capture with sensitive data filtering
  - Username/hostname detection (cross-platform)
  - Serialization for LLM prompt integration
- **ShellDetector**: Shell and platform detection utilities
  - Auto-detection from environment ($SHELL)
  - Fallback to POSIX sh for unknown shells
  - Platform-specific detection (Linux, macOS, Windows)

#### Logging Module (`src/logging/`)
- **Logger**: Structured logging with tracing integration
  - JSON and plain text format support
  - Log level configuration (Debug, Info, Warn, Error)
  - File and stdout output options
  - Operation span tracking for performance monitoring
- **Redaction**: Sensitive data filtering
  - Pattern-based redaction of API_KEY, TOKEN, PASSWORD, SECRET
  - Regex-based sensitive data detection

#### Infrastructure Models (`src/models/mod.rs`)
- Added infrastructure-specific types:
  - `Platform`: Operating system detection (Linux/macOS/Windows)
  - `SafetyLevel`: Command safety configuration (Strict/Moderate/Permissive)
  - `LogLevel`: Logging severity levels
  - `UserConfiguration`: User preferences with builder pattern
  - `ExecutionContext`: Complete execution environment model
  - `ConfigSchema`: Configuration schema validation
  - `CacheManifest`: Cache metadata structure

### Performance
- Context capture: <50ms (NFR-003) ✅
- Config loading: <100ms (NFR-002) ✅
- Cache operations: <5s for <1GB models (NFR-001) ✅
- Logging: Non-blocking with async I/O (NFR-004) ✅

### Testing
- 40 passing integration tests across all modules
- Comprehensive contract tests for each infrastructure component
- Cross-module integration scenarios validated
- Performance requirements verified in automated tests

### Dependencies Added
- `directories = "5"` - XDG directory resolution
- `dirs = "5"` - Platform-specific directories
- `toml = "0.8"` - TOML parsing for configuration
- `tracing = "0.1"` - Structured logging framework
