# cmdai

> 🚧 **Early Development Stage** - Architecture defined, core implementation in progress

**cmdai** converts natural language descriptions into safe POSIX shell commands using local LLMs. Built with Rust for blazing-fast performance, single-binary distribution, and safety-first design.

```bash
$ cmdai "list all PDF files in Downloads folder larger than 10MB"
Generated command:
  find ~/Downloads -name "*.pdf" -size +10M -ls

Execute this command? (y/N) y
```

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wildcard/cmdai.git
cd cmdai

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run the CLI
./target/release/cmdai --version
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Run tests
make test

# Format code
make fmt

# Run linter
make lint

# Build optimized binary
make build-release

# Run with debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -- "your command"
```

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Syntax (Planned)
```bash
cmdai [OPTIONS] <PROMPT>
```

### CLI Options (Designed)

| Option | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `--backend` | Inference backend (mlx, vllm, ollama) | 🚧 In Development |
| `--model` | Specific model ID or path | 🚧 In Development |
| `--auto` | Execute without confirmation | 📅 Planned |
| `--allow-dangerous` | Allow potentially dangerous commands | 📅 Planned |
| `--verbose` | Enable verbose logging | ✅ Available |

### Examples (Target Functionality)

```bash
# Simple command generation
cmdai "compress all images in current directory"

# With specific backend
cmdai --backend mlx "find large log files"

# Verbose mode for debugging
cmdai --verbose "show disk usage"
```

### Core Components

1. **CommandGenerator Trait** - Unified interface for all LLM backends
2. **SafetyValidator** - Command validation and risk assessment
3. **Backend System** - Extensible architecture for multiple inference engines
4. **Cache Manager** - Hugging Face model management (planned)

### Backend Architecture

```rust
#[async_trait]
trait CommandGenerator {
    async fn generate_command(&self, request: &CommandRequest) 
        -> Result<GeneratedCommand, GeneratorError>;
    async fn is_available(&self) -> bool;
    fn backend_info(&self) -> BackendInfo;
}
```

## 🔧 Development

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.75+ 
- Cargo
- Make (optional, for convenience commands)
- Docker (optional, for development container)

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Clone and enter the project
git clone https://github.com/wildcard/cmdai.git
cd cmdai

# Install dependencies and build
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Check formatting
cargo fmt -- --check

# Run clippy linter
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

### Project Configuration

The project uses several configuration files:
- `Cargo.toml` - Rust dependencies and build configuration
- `clippy.toml` - Linter rules
- `rustfmt.toml` - Code formatting rules
- `deny.toml` - Dependency audit configuration

### Testing Strategy

The project uses contract-based testing:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for backend implementations
- Contract tests to ensure trait compliance
- Property-based testing for safety validation

## 🛡️ Safety Features

The safety module is designed to prevent dangerous operations:

### Planned Safety Checks
- System destruction patterns (`rm -rf /`, `mkfs`)
- Fork bombs detection
- Device write operations
- Privilege escalation without explicit permission
- Path validation and quoting
- Command length limits

### Risk Levels
- **Safe** - Normal operations
- **Moderate** - Requires caution
- **High** - Potentially destructive
- **Critical** - System-threatening
