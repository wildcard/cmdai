 Tips for getting started:

  Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
  Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
  Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
  ✔ Run /terminal-setup to set up terminal integration

> /ide 
  ⎿  Connected to Visual Studio Code.

> /statusline is setting up statusLine… 
  ⎿  Allowed 3 tools for this command

● I'll help you set up your statusline configuration using your shell PS1. Let me create
  a task for the statusline-setup agent.

● statusline-setup(Configure statusline from PS1)
  ⎿  Done (5 tool uses · 3.6k tokens · 24.2s)                                           

● The statusline-setup agent couldn't find your PS1 configuration and needs more
  guidance. You have a few options:

  1. Set up a default status line with basic info
  2. Specify what you want displayed (directory, git branch, time, etc.)
  3. Provide your PS1 configuration manually

  What would you like your status line to show?

> git, abbd dir and rust

● statusline-setup(Configure statusline with git, dir, rust)
  ⎿  Done (8 tool uses · 8.0k tokens · 1m 58.5s)                                        

● Your statusline has been configured to show:

  - Abbreviated directory (last 2 path components)
  - Git branch with uncommitted changes indicator (*)
  - Rust info (project name or version)

  The agent provided the configuration but had permission issues. You'll need to manually
   create ~/.claude/settings.json with the provided config and restart Claude Code.
