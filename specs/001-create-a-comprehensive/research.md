# Phase 0: Research & Technical Decisions

## Overview
Research findings for cmdai CLI tool implementation, resolving technical unknowns and establishing architectural foundations.

## LLM Backend Integration Research

### Decision: Multi-Backend Trait System
**Rationale**: 
- Supports multiple inference engines (MLX, vLLM, Ollama) with unified interface
- Allows runtime backend selection based on availability and performance
- Enables easy addition of new backends without core changes

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single backend implementation: Rejected due to lack of flexibility
- Plugin-based system: Rejected due to complexity and binary size constraints
- Hardcoded backends: Rejected due to maintenance burden

### MLX Framework Integration
**Decision**: FFI bindings using cxx crate for safe C++ interop
**Rationale**:
- MLX provides optimal performance on Apple Silicon
- cxx crate ensures memory safety and proper resource management
- Unified memory architecture reduces data copying overhead

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct C bindings: Rejected due to safety concerns
- Python subprocess: Rejected due to performance overhead
- ONNX runtime: Considered but MLX native integration preferred

## Safety Validation Architecture

### Decision: Multi-layered validation pipeline
**Rationale**:
- Static pattern matching catches known dangerous commands
- Dynamic analysis assesses command structure and file system impact
- Risk-based confirmation system provides appropriate user warnings
- Configurable safety levels support different user expertise

**Pattern Database Design**:
- Embedded dangerous command patterns (compile-time inclusion)
- Regular expressions for flexible pattern matching
- Risk level classification (Safe, Moderate, High, Critical)
- User override mechanisms with explicit confirmation

## Command Generation & Prompt Engineering

### Decision: Strict JSON-only response format
**Rationale**:
- Eliminates parsing ambiguity and malformed responses
- Enables robust error handling and fallback strategies
- Supports structured command metadata (explanation, risk level)
- Facilitates testing and validation

**System Prompt Strategy**:
- POSIX compliance requirements embedded in prompt
- Safety constraints explicitly stated
- Example-driven format specification
- Context-aware command generation with system state

## Performance Optimization Research

### Binary Size Optimization
**Decision**: Aggressive size reduction techniques
- Link-time optimization (LTO) enabled
- Strip debug symbols in release builds
- Minimal dependency tree through careful feature selection
- Consider UPX compression for distribution

### Startup Performance
**Decision**: Lazy loading architecture
- Defer heavy dependency initialization until needed
- Pre-compile regex patterns as static data
- Configuration caching with validation checksums
- Minimal cold start path for common operations

### Memory Management
**Decision**: Bounded resource usage
- LRU cache eviction for model data
- Streaming response processing where possible
- Memory pool allocation for frequent operations
- Zero-copy parsing techniques

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

### Decision: Conditional compilation with feature flags
**Rationale**:
- Platform-specific optimizations (MLX on Apple Silicon)
- Graceful degradation when features unavailable
- Single codebase with platform-appropriate builds
- Clear separation of platform-specific code

**Platform Support Strategy**:
- Primary: macOS with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- Secondary: Linux (x86_64, ARM64) with CPU-only backends
- Tertiary: Windows with appropriate shell detection

## Model Caching & Management

### Decision: Hugging Face Hub integration with local caching
**Rationale**:
- Standardized model repository and distribution
- Automatic model downloading and version management
- Offline capability once models cached locally
- Integrity verification and checksum validation

**Cache Strategy**:
- User-configurable cache directory (~/.cmdai/models/)
- Model metadata tracking (version, size, performance metrics)
- Intelligent cache eviction based on usage patterns
- Atomic download operations for consistency

## Configuration Architecture

### Decision: Hierarchical configuration system
**Rationale**:
- Command-line arguments override configuration files
- Environment variables for deployment flexibility
- User and system-wide configuration support
- TOML format for human-readable configuration

**Configuration Hierarchy** (highest to lowest priority):
1. Command-line arguments
2. Environment variables (CMDAI_*)
3. User configuration (~/.config/cmdai/config.toml)
4. System configuration (/etc/cmdai/config.toml)
5. Default values

## Error Handling Strategy

### Decision: Comprehensive error categorization with recovery
**Error Categories**:
- User Input Errors: Invalid requests, ambiguous input
- Model Errors: Backend unavailable, generation failures
- System Errors: File system issues, permission problems
- Safety Errors: Dangerous command detection, validation failures

**Recovery Mechanisms**:
- Automatic backend fallback on failure
- Graceful degradation when models unavailable
- User-friendly error messages with actionable suggestions
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

## Testing Strategy Research

### Decision: Multi-level testing with real dependencies
**Testing Levels**:
- Contract tests: API contracts and backend interfaces
- Integration tests: End-to-end command generation workflows
- Property tests: Safety validation with random inputs
- Performance tests: Startup time, memory usage, inference speed

**Real Dependency Usage**:
- Actual LLM backends for integration testing
- Real file system operations for cache testing
- Live HTTP clients for remote backend testing
- Cross-platform compatibility validation

## Deployment & Distribution

### Decision: Single binary distribution with package manager support
**Distribution Channels**:
- GitHub Releases with pre-compiled binaries
- Package managers (Homebrew, apt, yum, Chocolatey)
- Cargo for Rust developers
- Docker images for containerized environments

**Build Process**:
- Cross-compilation for target platforms
- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Binary signing for security verification
- Checksum generation for integrity verification

## Implementation Readiness

All technical unknowns have been resolved with concrete decisions and rationale. The architecture supports the required performance targets, safety constraints, and cross-platform compatibility while maintaining simplicity and testability.

**Key Risk Mitigations**:
- MLX integration isolated behind trait abstraction
- Safety validation extensively tested with property-based testing
- Performance requirements validated through benchmarking
- Cross-platform compatibility ensured through conditional compilation
