# Feature Specification: cmdai - Natural Language to Shell Command CLI Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-comprehensive`  
**Created**: 2025-09-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a comprehensive specification for cmdai, a Rust CLI tool that converts natural language descriptions into safe POSIX shell commands using local LLMs."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer wants to perform a file system operation but doesn't remember the exact command syntax. They describe their intent in plain English to cmdai, which generates the appropriate shell command, explains what it will do, and asks for confirmation before executing it safely.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user wants to find files, **When** they type `cmdai "find all PDF files larger than 10MB in Downloads folder"`, **Then** the system generates `find ~/Downloads -name "*.pdf" -size +10M -type f`, displays it with safety indicators, explains the command's purpose, and requests confirmation before execution.

2. **Given** a user requests a potentially dangerous operation, **When** they type `cmdai "delete all files in this directory"`, **Then** the system generates the command, displays a RED warning indicator, explains the risks, requires explicit confirmation with additional safety prompts, and logs the action.

3. **Given** a user provides an ambiguous request, **When** they type `cmdai "compress files"`, **Then** the system asks clarifying questions about which files, compression format, and destination before generating any command.

4. **Given** the system cannot safely interpret a request, **When** a user asks for something potentially harmful or unclear, **Then** the system refuses to generate a command and suggests alternative approaches or asks for clarification.

5. **Given** a user wants to explore shell capabilities, **When** they type `cmdai "show me disk usage by directory"`, **Then** the system generates `du -sh */ | sort -hr`, explains that it shows directory sizes sorted by largest first, and executes after confirmation.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the local LLM is unavailable or returns malformed responses?
- How does the system handle commands that require elevated privileges (sudo)?
- What occurs when a user requests commands for files or directories that don't exist?
- How does the system respond to requests that would require interactive input from subsequent commands?
- What happens when the generated command would have side effects beyond the user's apparent intent?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept natural language descriptions as command-line input and convert them to valid POSIX shell commands
- **FR-002**: System MUST display generated commands with clear formatting and color-coded safety indicators (green/yellow/red) before execution
- **FR-003**: System MUST require explicit user confirmation before executing any generated command
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate all generated commands against a comprehensive database of dangerous patterns and system-critical operations
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear explanations of what each generated command will accomplish
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent execution of commands that could cause system damage without explicit user override
- **FR-007**: System MUST support multiple local LLM backends for command generation
- **FR-008**: System MUST function offline once models are locally cached
- **FR-009**: System MUST start up within 100 milliseconds to maintain responsive user experience
- **FR-010**: System MUST generate commands within 2 seconds for typical requests
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain a memory footprint under 500MB during operation
- **FR-012**: System MUST be distributed as a single binary under 50MB in size
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide informative error messages and suggestions when command generation fails
- **FR-014**: System MUST allow users to configure safety levels (strict, moderate, permissive)
- **FR-015**: System MUST support automatic model downloading and caching from model repositories
- **FR-016**: System MUST detect and adapt to different shell environments and platform capabilities
- **FR-017**: System MUST log command generation and execution for audit purposes
- **FR-018**: System MUST handle rate limiting and graceful degradation when using remote model services
- **FR-019**: System MUST achieve >90% accuracy in generating correct commands for common user intents
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide benchmarking and performance recommendations for different model backends

### Key Entities
- **Command Request**: Natural language description provided by user, including context and intent
- **Generated Command**: Shell command produced by LLM, including safety assessment and explanation
- **Safety Rule**: Pattern or condition that determines command risk level and execution permissions
- **Model Backend**: LLM inference engine (local or remote) used for command generation
- **User Configuration**: Personalized settings for safety levels, output preferences, and model selection
- **Command History**: Record of generated and executed commands for audit and learning purposes
- **Model Cache**: Local storage of downloaded models and their metadata for offline operation
