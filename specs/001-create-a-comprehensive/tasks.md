# Tasks: cmdai - Natural Language to Shell Command CLI Tool

**Input**: Design documents from `/workspaces/cmdai/specs/001-create-a-comprehensive/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: Rust 1.75+, clap, tokio, serde, anyhow dependencies
   → Structure: Single CLI binary with modular backend system
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: 7 core entities (CommandRequest, GeneratedCommand, etc.)
   → contracts/: 3 contract files (backend-trait, safety-validator, cli-interface)
   → research.md: Multi-backend trait system, FFI bindings, safety pipeline
   → quickstart.md: Installation scenarios, usage examples, integration tests
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Rust project, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: 3 contract tests, 5 integration scenarios, property tests
   → Core: 7 models, backend system, safety validation, CLI interface
   → Integration: model caching, configuration, logging
   → Polish: performance optimization, documentation
4. Apply TDD rules: All tests before implementation
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T038)
6. Mark parallel tasks [P] for different files
```

## Dependencies
**Critical Path**:
- Setup (T001-T005) before everything
- All tests (T006-T015) before any implementation (T016+)
- Models (T016-T023) before services and backends
- Backend system (T024-T028) before CLI integration
- Safety system (T029-T032) before command execution
- Core pipeline (T043-T046) depends on backends and safety
- Performance optimization (T047-T050) after core functionality
- Polish (T051-T056) after everything else

**Parallel Execution Blocks**:
- Setup tasks T003-T005 can run together
- Contract tests T006-T008 can run together  
- Integration tests T009-T013 can run together
- Model definitions T016-T023 can run together
- Backend implementations T025-T026 can run together
- CLI subcommands T034-T037 can run together

## Parallel Execution Examples

```bash
# Launch T006-T008 in parallel:
Task: "Backend trait contract tests in tests/contract/test_backend_trait.rs"
Task: "Safety validator contract tests in tests/contract/test_safety_validator.rs"  
Task: "CLI interface contract tests in tests/contract/test_cli_interface.rs"
```

### Phase 3.3: Launch all model definitions together
```bash
# Launch T016-T023 in parallel:
Task: "CommandRequest struct in src/models/command_request.rs"
Task: "GeneratedCommand struct in src/models/generated_command.rs"
Task: "SafetyRule struct in src/models/safety_rule.rs"
Task: "ModelBackendConfig struct in src/models/backend_config.rs"
Task: "UserConfiguration struct in src/models/user_config.rs"
Task: "CommandHistory struct in src/models/command_history.rs"
Task: "ModelCache struct in src/models/model_cache.rs"
Task: "Core enumerations in src/models/enums.rs"
```

### Phase 3.5: Launch backend implementations
```bash
# Launch T025-T026 in parallel (T027 depends on cxx setup):
Task: "Ollama backend implementation in src/backends/ollama.rs"
Task: "vLLM backend implementation in src/backends/vllm.rs"
```

## Task Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked before execution*

- [x] All contracts (3) have corresponding contract tests (T006-T008)
- [x] All entities (7) have model creation tasks (T016-T023)  
- [x] All tests (T006-T015) come before implementation (T016+)
- [x] Parallel tasks [P] operate on different files
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] TDD cycle enforced: failing tests before implementation
- [x] Dependencies properly ordered and documented
- [x] Performance targets addressed in dedicated tasks
- [x] Cross-platform compatibility handled
- [x] Safety-first approach maintained throughout

## Performance Targets Validation
- **T047**: Startup time <100ms validation
- **T048**: Memory usage <500MB validation  
- **T049**: Binary size <50MB validation
- **T050**: Inference time <2s validation
- **T056**: End-to-end performance validation

## Safety Requirements Validation  
- **T007**: Safety validator contract tests (dangerous pattern detection)
- **T010**: Safety feature integration tests (risk levels, confirmations)
- **T014**: Property tests for safety rules edge cases
- **T029-T032**: Complete safety validation system implementation

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, safe for parallel execution
- All tests must fail before implementing corresponding functionality
- Commit after each task completion
- MLX backend (T027) requires careful FFI integration with cxx crate
- Performance optimization tasks (T047-T050) are critical for meeting targets
- Safety system implementation is non-negotiable and must be comprehensive
