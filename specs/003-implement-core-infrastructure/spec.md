# Feature Specification: Core Infrastructure Modules

**Feature Branch**: `003-implement-core-infrastructure`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement core infrastructure modules: Hugging Face model caching with offline support and directory management, configuration management with CLI integration and user preferences, execution context with environment capture and shell detection, and structured logging with tracing integration for observability"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: 4 core modules (cache, config, execution, logging)
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: CLI users, system administrator, developers
   ‚Üí Actions: cache models, manage config, capture context, log events
   ‚Üí Data: cached models, user preferences, environment state, log entries
   ‚Üí Constraints: offline support, directory management, observability
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Model storage location: Use XDG/platform conventions
   ‚Üí Config file format: TOML for user-friendliness
   ‚Üí Logging format: Structured JSON for machine parsing
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Cache: Download once, use offline
   ‚Üí Config: Set preferences, persist across sessions
   ‚Üí Execution: Capture environment for command generation
   ‚Üí Logging: Track operations for debugging
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí 20 testable requirements across 4 modules
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí CachedModel, UserConfig, ExecutionContext, LogEntry
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details (Rust, specific crates avoided)
   ‚Üí Focus on user value and system behavior
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT the infrastructure provides and WHY it's needed
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no Rust types, crate names, file formats in requirements)
- üë• Written for understanding system capabilities, not implementation

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story: Model Caching
**As a** CLI user
**I want** models to be downloaded once and cached locally
**So that** I can use cmdai offline without re-downloading models every time

**Flow**:
1. User runs cmdai for first time with a model
2. System downloads model from Hugging Face and caches it locally
3. User runs cmdai again (possibly offline)
4. System loads model from cache instead of downloading
5. User can manually clear cache if needed

### Primary User Story: Configuration Management
**As a** CLI user
**I want** to save my preferred settings (safety level, default shell, model)
**So that** I don't have to specify them on every command invocation

**Flow**:
1. User sets preferences via CLI flags or config file
2. System persists preferences to user configuration directory
3. User runs cmdai without flags
4. System applies saved preferences as defaults
5. CLI flags override saved preferences when provided

### Primary User Story: Execution Context
**As a** command generator
**I want** to know the user's environment (current directory, shell, OS)
**So that** I can generate contextually appropriate commands

**Flow**:
1. User invokes cmdai with a prompt
2. System captures execution context (pwd, shell type, platform, env vars)
3. System passes context to command generator
4. Generator creates platform-specific, context-aware command
5. User receives command tailored to their environment

### Primary User Story: Structured Logging
**As a** system administrator or developer
**I want** detailed, structured logs of cmdai operations
**So that** I can debug issues and monitor system behavior

**Flow**:
1. User runs cmdai with verbose logging enabled
2. System logs operations with structured metadata (timestamps, levels, context)
3. Developer/admin reviews logs to understand behavior
4. Logs include performance metrics (timings, resource usage)
5. Critical errors are logged with full context for debugging

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Cache Management
1. **Given** no cached models exist, **When** user requests command generation, **Then** system downloads model and caches it in platform-appropriate directory
2. **Given** model is already cached, **When** user requests command generation offline, **Then** system loads model from cache without network access
3. **Given** cache directory is full or corrupted, **When** user runs cmdai, **Then** system detects issue and provides clear error message with recovery steps

#### Configuration Management
1. **Given** user has never configured cmdai, **When** user runs cmdai, **Then** system uses sensible defaults (Moderate safety, auto-detect shell)
2. **Given** user sets default safety level to Strict, **When** user runs cmdai without safety flag, **Then** system uses Strict safety level
3. **Given** user provides CLI flag `--safety permissive`, **When** config has Strict, **Then** CLI flag overrides config (Permissive used)

#### Execution Context
1. **Given** user is in `/home/user/Downloads`, **When** cmdai generates command, **Then** context includes current directory for relative path resolution
2. **Given** user runs cmdai in PowerShell on Windows, **When** command is generated, **Then** system detects PowerShell and generates Windows-specific command
3. **Given** relevant environment variables exist (PATH, HOME), **When** command is generated, **Then** context captures and makes them available to generator

#### Structured Logging
1. **Given** user enables verbose logging, **When** operations occur, **Then** system logs events with timestamps, severity levels, and structured metadata
2. **Given** an error occurs during command generation, **When** logging is enabled, **Then** system logs full error context (stack trace, environment, inputs)
3. **Given** developer needs to measure performance, **When** reviewing logs, **Then** logs include timing information for each operation stage

### Edge Cases

#### Cache Management
- What happens when cache directory doesn't have write permissions?
- How does system handle partial/corrupted model downloads?
- What if user manually deletes cache files while cmdai is running?
- How much disk space is reserved for cache? Is there a size limit?
- What happens when Hugging Face API is unreachable?

#### Configuration Management
- What if config file contains invalid TOML syntax?
- What if config file has unknown/deprecated keys?
- How are config file schema versions handled during upgrades?
- What if config directory is read-only?
- Can multiple cmdai instances safely write to config concurrently?

#### Execution Context
- What if current directory is deleted after cmdai starts?
- How are non-ASCII paths handled in execution context?
- What if shell environment variables contain sensitive data (passwords)?
- How does system detect shell type if SHELL env var is missing?
- What happens on platforms with non-standard directory structures?

#### Structured Logging
- What if log directory fills up available disk space?
- How are log files rotated or cleaned up over time?
- What if logging subsystem itself fails (out of disk, permissions)?
- How are sensitive data (API keys, user input) redacted from logs?
- What log levels are available and what does each capture?
